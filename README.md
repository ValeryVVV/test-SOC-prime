## About Project

This project is based on a layout from Figma.

Task:

1. Create a side, vikory and offensive stack: HTML, SCSS/SASS, JS/JQUERY, BEM.
   Sidebar design added. The file must be imported into Figma.
2. The height of the side can be adjusted to the height of the screen.
3. When hovering over an element (card), a hover effect may be created; when
   clicked, it will become inactive; and when hovered, a modal window will
   appear.
4. When you click on the “Get Started” button, a modal window will appear and
   the card will become active.
5. When you click on the “GET STARTED” button in the modal window, a POST
   request may appear, you need to send a login click, the text to the event
   (Click On Get Started Button From Modal) then the modal may close. When you
   click on the button (Cancel, Close(x)), an event with the text (Click On
   Close Button From Modal) may be sent.
6. When you click on “Compare plans”, the popup cannot open.
7. (Compare plans, Join Discord, Contact Us) for this initial message, you can
   add # for the href;
8. Work on the tablet (1024px) and mobile (768px) versions at your own
   discretion, otherwise the layout may be buggy and work in all extensions. The
   minimum screen width is 375px, the maximum is 4k, but the content is 1920px,
   so header = 4k, main = 1920px.
9. The code must be uploaded to GIT.
